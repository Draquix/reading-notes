## Markdown in a Nutshell

Markdown is a way of formatting files, especially of the readme variety on github. It uses text characters to change visual properties of text. Using from one to
six numbersigns followed by a space creates headers in which the text is displayed larger from one sign being largest to six being the smallest. text can be made 
bold by placing two asterix's before and after the portion of text to be emboldened with no spaces. Italics can be made with single asterix characters before and 
after the text. Links can be added by putting the name of the link in square brackets and the url within parenthesis braces.
