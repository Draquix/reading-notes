## How Computers Work

#### What makes a computer a computer:
A computer takes input, stores information, processes the data,
and returns output.  Computers were once the size of a room. That a
computer takes input allows the user to direct the tasks of the 
computer. Memory allows it to retain information as it processses
it and the processing functionality allows it to solve equations or
provide answers that help the user. To be able to give output is 
how computers provide processed or stored data to a user which 
gives it purpose.

#### Binary and Data
Computers think in terms of yes/no, on/off, 0/1... Since computers 
are electrical constructs this binary nature stems from a wire that
conducts electricity either has a current or it does not. All data
can be represented in a numerical fashion. All numbers we use
can be rendered down to zero's and one's if those digits are 
grouped together as bits and bytes.

#### Circuits and Logic
Circuits conduct electricity when on, or the don't while off. This 
on/off nature represents the zero's and one's that make up all 
data. A single circuit reading on or off gives us a 'not' 
function. Two circuits leading to one output represents the logic 
of 'and'. Two circuits in and out allows us to add. Many adder's 
together are used to handle larger numbers. Computers work by doing
simple calculations a human could do, except a computer can do many
many of these calculations at a time, way more than a human mind 
can actively process.

#### CPU, Memory, Input/Output
Part of a computer is the devices that take in input, like the 
keyboard. The keyboard converts a letter to a binary number.
The cpu calculates what that number represents, and sends it to
storage, and then after processing what it means to a greater 
whole, it calculates that number representing the keypress into a 
number that visually represents the graphic of that letter pressed 
and sends it to the screen to be ouput. 

#### Hardware and Software
The CPU controls all other parts of the computer. It has some 
circuits to calculate numbers, and other circuits that relay input 
and outport, and other circuits that send the signals to memory.
*Drawing a rectangle on the screen takes hundreds of smaller calculations.*
Software directs the CPU to act in different ways. Multiple 
software programs can run at the same time. The operating system
directs the multiple programs allowing them to share the same CPU.
