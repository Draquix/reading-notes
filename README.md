#### A personal project I started in order to utilize the lessons I was learning on Kahn Academy about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS: (hosted on Repl.it due to an as yet unresolved error in porting the code to GitHub)::
[A Hero's Journey(game)](https://darkturquoisedarkmagentagzip.danielrogahn.repl.co/)
It's a 1980's style text rpg using year 2020 technologies.
