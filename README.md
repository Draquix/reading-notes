Intro to coding and software development.

Markdown is a way of formatting files, especially of the readme variety on github.  It uses text characters to change visual properties of text.
Using from one to six numbersigns followed by a space creates headers in which the text is displayed larger from one sign being largest to six being the smallest.
text can be made bold by placing two asterix's before and after the portion of text to be emboldened with no spaces. Italics can be made with single asterix characters before and after the text.
Links can be added by putting the name of the link in square brackets and the url within parenthesis braces.

## Bio and Intro:
My name is Daniel Rogahn, I often publish under the handle Draquix. I obtained an AA degree at KirkwoodCC almost 20 years ago in Early Childhood Education. I taught preschool for four years or so but when my son came along I went back to foodservice as it pays more than teaching preschool. He's now 15 and has his sights set on College in 4 years, so I'm looking to switch from foodservice to something that's both more lucrative and interesting.
My first experiences with coding was when I was 9 my dad downloaded a game from AOL for me in which you used a PASCAL derived language to program a robot in simulated combat. Up to eight robots would fight in an arena. All the robots had the same virtual hardware specs so the winners were the best coded contestants. Then when I was 11 I obtained a TRS-80 at a garage sale and taught myself the line numbered form of BASIC that was used on it, and Apple II's, and Commodore 64's... I have returned to code as a hobby throughout my life but usually I get familiar with the basics of a language through textbooks, and then I make a few starter projects, and then I decide I don't have the time to make something on a large scale or income generating so I never stuck with it. Now though, that I realize how much I want a career working with coding, I'm very glad to know the basics of C++, C#, VBASIC, Python, and JavaScript.
I'm currently following the course curriculum for DeltaV code school on the track of software design.

## The Growth Mindset:

- The growth mindset refers to a state of mind which cultivates a willingness to grow through challenges and adversity, and by personal achievements in overcoming obstacles leads to a person who is always becoming a better version of who they are or once were.

- A growth mindset in pertaining to intellectual abilities, is to believe that such things as intelligence, memory, learning comprehension are Not static phenomenon's but rather qualities that can be strengthened and developed to further and further extents of cognitive abiliity.

- A growth mindset is essential to being a successful software developer, as one must be willing to deal with errors or problems as challenges to be overcome, not walls to impede all further progress, and at times one must be able to innovate new ways of doing things.

### Growth Mindset Reminders:
  1. When I encounter a problem within my code, it is an opportunity to learn something.
  2. If something isn't working the way I want it to, I should remember there are multiple ways to do some things and perhaps a different angle is in order.
  3. As long as I'm willing to make the effort towards success, I will become more prone to success as the mind is like a muscle that gets stronger with use.
  
  #### A project I made as I followed Kahn Accademy's Intro to Javascript and Animations course:
  This is a work in progress and thus an incomplete game, there are a number of known bugs that I haven't gotten around to fixing yet, it was mainly a way to experiment with 
  JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using a game concept that was simple and familiar. I will port it to git.hub within a day or two. [The Hero's Journey](https://DarkturquoiseDarkmagentaGzip.danielrogahn.repl.co)
