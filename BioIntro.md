  
## A little bit about me:

My name is Daniel Rogahn, I often publish under the handle Draquix. I obtained an AA degree at KirkwoodCC almost 20 years ago in Early Childhood Education. I taught
preschool for four years or so but when my son came along I went back to foodservice as it pays more than teaching preschool. He's now 15 and has his sights set on
College in 4 years, so I'm looking to switch from foodservice to something that's both more lucrative and interesting. My first experiences with coding was when I 
was 9 my dad downloaded a game from AOL for me in which you used a PASCAL derived language to program a robot in simulated combat. Up to eight robots would fight in
an arena. All the robots had the same virtual hardware specs so the winners were the best coded contestants. Then when I was 11 I obtained a TRS-80 at a garage sale
and taught myself the line numbered form of BASIC that was used on it, and Apple II's, and Commodore 64's... I have returned to code as a hobby throughout my life but
usually I get familiar with the basics of a language through textbooks, and then I make a few starter projects, and then I decide I don't have the time to make something
on a large scale or income generating so I never stuck with it. Now though, that I realize how much I want a career working with coding, I'm very glad to know the basics
of C++, C#, VBASIC, Python, and JavaScript. I'm currently following the course curriculum for DeltaV code school on the track of software design
