## Reading Notes for HTML5

One major edition in HTML5 is that there are multiple block 
elements to replace the older multipurpos div tag. A key 
element of design is to create your page and display its content
with a specific audience in mind. One must also consider the 
purpose your website is trying to fulfill. The textbook 
reccomends generating fictional characters from different 
backgrounds and intentions to guage how to aim your site towards
its audience.
A site map is a way to see the entirety of your website when in 
actuality the website is a number of different pages connected
by hypertext link or JavaScript powered buttons. The home page or
sometimes called "splash page" is the first users are most likely
to encounter when following an outside link or search engine 
result. It is at the top of the site map. Next are sections on 
specific topics, and under them are more information on the 
topics. In some ways it resembles an upside down tree. A 
wireframe goes into greater detail by depicting the general 
layout of each page without actually coding it just yet. 
Content should start out broad and focus more into exactly what 
the userneeds to find, and the broader subjects should take a 
higher priority than narrower points of interest so as to guide 
users to exactly what they're meant to find. The way elements are
grouped either together or apart, in a line or scattered can be
utilized as a way to direct the user's flow of attention. 
Navigation through the site should be simple and as intuitive as
possible in that a user should know how to get where they're 
going in the site without training, documentation, or live 
direction.

HTML is a way to display text and images with certain formatting,
and through the use of JavaScript, be interactive. HTML is 
implemented using tags.
    
    <body>
        <h1> This Text Would Be Really Big </h1>
        <p> This is standard size using a P tag that stands for
        paragraph </p>
    </body>
    
In that example, I've illustrated how tags work, in that there's 
usually an opening tag and content within it that follows certain
rules, like the h1 tag will make text very large, and is meant
for headlines that grab a user's attention quicker than smaller
text. At the end of the text that is desired to be larger is the
closing /h1 tag. The same characters preceeded by a slash tells
the browser to stop applying that rule. Similarly the p tag is
used to denote a paragraph. All of it is enclosed in the bodytag
which simply refers to the main portion of the page. The 
body tag could be preceeded by a <header> and proceeded by a
footer and those sections may or may not follow other rules.
There are many more tags used in HTML, but these examples give 
you the general idea of how they're structured and employed by
using a hiearchy of content enclosed within beginning and 
/ending tags.

Back to revisions in HTML 5 as in Chapter 17 of our book, the 
single multi-purpose div tag has been demoted a bit and more
content specific tags have been introduced. The header, footer, 
nav, article, and aside tags all deliver content in a way that
div was used exclusively to do. They don't all act exactly the 
same way as Div, they have somewhat differing default styling 
rules before being altered by CSS, but they serve the same 
function of delivering content in an attractive layout form, and 
also in grouping together like items, and providing a constant, 
stable way to navigate through a uniform site. It has also been
revised in HTML5 that these sections can be included in an a 
tag which anchors a link to another section, page, or website.
