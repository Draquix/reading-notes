## Reading Notes for HTML Chapters 3 and 13, and JavaScript 2 and 4
A list tag contains an ordered or unordered list. They can be nested.
In the box model, the width and height are measured in pixels, or percentage of 
the screen's width. A min-width can be specified so that a the box gets no 
smaller than is specified. It will sometimes cause issues with the layout on 
smaller devices. When content exceeds a set limit it's overflow. It can be hidden
out of view or scrolled through depending on the CSS property set. The padding is
the inside, the border surrounds it, the margin is how far from another box it
can be. Border's have several style settings as well as customizable color. The
margin attribute accepts four measurements in the order of top right bottom left.
Generally each box gets its own horizontal rule with the next being below, unless
the display is set to inline or inline-block. The border radius rounds corners.
 Values in arrays can be of multiple data types and are accessed by the index in
 square brackets starting at 0.
Switch statements present different code blocks to be executed for which case is
selected. JavaScript will sometimes act as if a number in a string is the same as
an integer of the same amount, it's called truthy.
Evaluations using OR can be 'short circuited'. The first true statement is the 
last evaluation as the program flow continues on to the block in the if statement.
Loops will perform a block of code while a statement is true, and the amount of
times the loop is performed can be set by evaluating a variable that changes in
increments.
