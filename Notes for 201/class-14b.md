### Transforms
Transforms are often depicted in CSS as browser specific commands. They may be
2d or 3d.  transform: rotate(x deg); will rotate an image/element. scale( decimal 
) will change the sizing of something.  skew will distort an element along the
vertical or horizontal scale. Transforms can be combined.
perspective gives a relative origin for the pre-transformation.
### Transitions and Animations
Transitions use pseudo classes like :focus or :hover or :target.
the transition-property points at what to be changed.
the transition-duration gives a x(s); number second timeframe
the transition-timing-function gives an idea of how to flow events from start to 
end
shorthand for transition follows property, duration, timing-function, delay order.

animations are like transitions that keep running. the animation-iteration-count 
can be set to limit this
The direction of an animation can be set through animation-direction
an animation-play-state can be controlled as set to 'paused' or 'running'

using :hover along with a one or two line CSS rule can cause a neat effect
