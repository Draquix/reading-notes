HTML can be used to structure lists that are ordered by enumerating each item, or
unordered which may use a bullet point or no symbol depending on the CSS style, or
be concepts with definitions.  Lists can be nested inside lists.

The size of the boxes that surround elements can be measured in pixels (px), ems 
(which are standard size of the font), or by percentages. Width and height can be
controlled by CSS. Sometimes information doesn't fit within a box, and it's called
overflow. Overflow can be hidden or have a scroll bar or bleed over the next 
element(though it's not recommended practice). The box model is that a box's 
content is the padding, which has a border, and then there's a margin of space 
between other items and all these things can be manipulated with CSS. A property
display can have the inline-block attribute which allows elements to be side by
side. The border radius can control rounded edges.

Statements are single instructions, one step in executing a task. An expression is
when things are compared in a way that returns true or false or performs a 
mathematical operation. Data can be stored in a variable, and an array can hold 
multiple bits of data. Operators indicate math to be performed.

Code often needs to make a decision. If statements evaluate an expression and 
execute code dependant on whether it's true or false. An if else is run if the 
preceding evaluation was false. Some evaluations are greater than less than or 
equal to. Sometimes we want to do things multiple times with a loop.  A while loop
does it as long as an expression is true. A for loop sets a variable that counts
and limits how many times it can be run.  A do while loop does the code once and
then evaluates whether to do it again.
