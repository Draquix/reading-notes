## Reading Lab 14a
Team dynamics can be measured by many many quantifications of data, many qualities
of how the members work together, or what traits the individuals have. The key to
success is in the unspoken norms.  What matters most is how members treat each 
other.  Members had to feel safe in taking the risk to contribute.  The human 
element of being emotionally connected was the most important part of the group.
### Transforms
Transforms are often depicted in CSS as browser specific commands. They may be
2d or 3d.  transform: rotate(x deg); will rotate an image/element. scale( decimal 
) will change the sizing of something.  skew will distort an element along the
vertical or horizontal scale. Transforms can be combined.
perspective gives a relative origin for the pre-transformation.
### Transitions and Animations
Transitions use pseudo classes like :focus or :hover or :target.
the transition-property points at what to be changed.
the transition-duration gives a x(s); number second timeframe
the transition-timing-function gives an idea of how to flow events from start to 
end
shorthand for transition follows property, duration, timing-function, delay order.

animations are like transitions that keep running. the animation-iteration-count 
can be set to limit this
The direction of an animation can be set through animation-direction
an animation-play-state can be controlled as set to 'paused' or 'running'

using :hover along with a one or two line CSS rule can cause a neat effect
