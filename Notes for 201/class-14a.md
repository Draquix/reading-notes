Team dynamics can be measured by many many quantifications of data, many qualities
of how the members work together, or what traits the individuals have. The key to
success is in the unspoken norms.  What matters most is how members treat each 
other.  Members had to feel safe in taking the risk to contribute.  The human 
element of being emotionally connected was the most important part of the group.
Sharing personal stories, or traumas, or difficult times and feeling 
psychologically safe seemed to have a greater impact on the performance of a team 
than the overall intellectual makeup of the team, or any combination of 
leadership qualities, social interactions, or general mannerisms of the 
individuals.
